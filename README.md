This is just the frontend application and hence the login credentials are not cross verified against any hardcoded values. Login with whatever credentials you have

This app uses Clarifai Face Detect API for the process.
So for this app to work make sure that you have your own clarifai api key 
Get it from here [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/).
Also create your own API key in that website.
